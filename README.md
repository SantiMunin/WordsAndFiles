WordsAndFiles
=============

Simple application built upon node.js where users can chat and send files to each other. Based on the [Nacho Soto's talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1FcQPYoZZk) at Betabeers.

It makes use of:
  + Socket.io (web socket, so no ajax polling is done)
  + Express
  + Jade
  + Twitter Bootstrap

A lot to do.
